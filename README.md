# EvindarUcdere-postgresql-bi-analysis
🎯 Overview
This repository contains advanced Business Intelligence (BI) SQL queries I wrote to strengthen my expertise in PostgreSQL.

All analyses are performed using the Northwind and DVD Rental sample databases.

🧠 Focus Areas
My goal was to move beyond basic SELECT statements and practice advanced techniques. The queries in this repo focus on:

Analytical Queries: Using Window Functions like LAG() (for trend comparison) and ROW_NUMBER() (for ranking).

Query Readability: Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down complex problems into simple, logical steps.

Advanced JOINs: Using LATERAL JOIN as a performance alternative for "Top-N-per-Group" reports.

Aggregation: Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and CASE statements for standard business reporting.

🗄️ Databases Used
Northwind: Used to practice sales, employee, and product analysis.

DVD Rental: Used to practice customer behavior and rental pattern analysis.

📂 Repository Structure
Queries are organized into folders by database.

📊 Objective
To perform realistic BI-style analysis and gain a deeper, practical understanding of PostgreSQL’s analytical features.
